+1. What is a bug?
+A bug is a part of code that is not doing what it is supposed to do. 
+2. What is a bug fix?
+A bug fix is the correction for a bug
+3. What is a bug report?
+A bug report is the information about the bug found, the developer name, the priority, the related files and so on.
+4. What is a test case?
+A test case is a set of input and expected output that can be used to determine if the software is working properly. 
+5. What is branch coverage?
+Branch coverage is the test coverage that checks the true and false statements of a branch to determine if it is working properly.
+6. What is path coverage?
+Path coverage is the test coverage that checks if all the possible paths of a branch are working properly.
+7. What is mutation testing?
+Mutation testing is testing a software to determine if the tests are able to detect all the mutations.
+8. Is mutation testing a good strategy to detect bugs?
+Mutation testing is not a good strategy to detect bugs. It is a good strategy to determine if the tests are good enough. 
+9. What is statistical testing?
+Statistical testing is using statistical models to check if a software is working properly. 
+10. What is test-driven development?
+Test-driven development is a strategy to write test first and then write the code.
