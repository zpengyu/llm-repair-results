+You will be provided with the following data set:
+(A) A dataset of 240 Java projects (Buggy)
+(B) A dataset of 240 Java projects (Fixed)
+Each project has the following structure:
+(A) It contains a directory named "src", which contains all the source files.
+(B) It also contains a directory named "buggy", which contains one of the buggy files.
+(C) It also contains a directory named "fixed", which contains the fixed file.
+Note: Each buggy file has a different bug than the others.
