+The first step in code deletions is to find all the files that were changed in the commits that were analysed. We store the file names and the SHA-1 value of the file in a hash map where the SHA-1 value is the key and the value is the file name. When we find a line that has been deleted, we use the SHA-1 value of the file to get the file name and then write the deleted lines to a file, along with the SHA-1 value of the file. This way, we end up with a file which contains all the deleted lines of code with their corresponding SHA-1 value of the file.
