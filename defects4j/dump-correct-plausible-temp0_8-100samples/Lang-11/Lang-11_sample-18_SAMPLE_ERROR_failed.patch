+1. Can you give a example of a fix provided by z3? 
+```
+class FibonacciExample {
+    public static void main(String args[]) {
+        int n1 = 0, n2 = 1, n3, i, count = 10;
+        System.out.print(n1 + " " + n2);
+        for (i = 2; i < count; ++i) {
+            n3 = n1 - n2;
+            System.out.print(" " + n3);
+            n1 = n2;
+            n2 = n3;
+        }

+2. How many type of bugs have you found on the buggy classes?
+```
+Buggy Function: in total 23
+Syntax Error: 14
+Type Error: 6
+Fixed Function: in total 27
+Syntax Error: 0
+Type Error: 0
+```
+3. How many possible fixes are provided by z3?
+```
+Buggy Function: in total 538
+Syntax Error: 538
+Type Error: 0
+Fixed Function: in total 1696
+Syntax Error: 0
+Type Error: 0
+```
+4. How many fixes are correct?
+```
+Buggy Function: in total 1
+Syntax Error: 1
+Type Error: 0
+Fixed Function: in total 0
+Syntax Error: 0
+Type Error: 0
+```
+5. Explain what are the problems in the buggy functions.
+```
+1. If a function is not defined in a class, it could not be used.
+2. The type of a variable should be correct.
+3. The right symbol should be used on the right place.
+4. If there is a "else" clause, there should be a "if" clause.
+5. Variable's name should be started with a letter.
+```
+6. Explain what are the problems in the fixed functions.
+```
+1. The type of a variable should be correct.
+2. The right symbol should be used on the right place.
+3. Variable's name should be started with a letter.
+4. If there is a "else" clause, there should be a "if" clause.
+5. If a function is not defined in a class, it could not be used.
+6. The statement should be ended with ";".
+7. The function should be ended with "{}".
+8. The method should be ended with ")".
+9. If a function is supposed to return some value, there should be a "return" statement.
+10. Parentheses should be consistent.
+```
+7. Explain the limitation of your tool.
+```
+1. Since we are focusing on Java, the tool could only be used to find syntax errors and type errors in Java.
+2. The tool could only be used to find the errors in small programs. The bugs would be covered by the error I/O.
