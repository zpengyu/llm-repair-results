+Write a function tokenize that takes in code as a string and returns an array of tokens.
+You can use any tokens you like, but the function should return distinct strings.
+Some examples of tokens are the following:
+- var
+- a variable name
+- a string
+- a number
+- parentheses
+- comma
+- curly braces
+- square brackets
+- a semicolon
+- etc.
+Note that you should try to tokenize the input code into as many tokens as possible, but you also don't need to tokenize everything.
+You can omit tokens that are not important for the project.
