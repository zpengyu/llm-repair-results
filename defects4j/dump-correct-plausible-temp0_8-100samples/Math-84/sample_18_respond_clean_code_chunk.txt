In this section, you are to provide a demonstration of the use of FindBugs
with some program provided by the teacher (or yourself).  You should provide
the following:
* A brief description of the program and its purpose (1-2 sentences)
* A list of all bugs that FindBugs detects in the program (**three or more**).  For each bug you detect, you must include the following:
    * the bug report (in textual format)
    * a brief explanation of what the bug is, why it is a problem, and how it might be fixed (1-3 sentences)
    * a bug-fixed version of the buggy code, if it is short enough.
* A brief discussion of how FindBugs might be useful to you (1-2 sentences).
