# Finding Bugs
* In this section, we will look at some of the most commonly used strategies that humans use to find bugs in their code.
* We will then look at two example strategies and show how they can be mimicked by machine learning algorithms.

## Understanding Bug Fixing Strategies
* To understand the strategies of bug fixing, we will look at some bug reports, fix patches and a checker for bugs.
