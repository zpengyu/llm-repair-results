## Fixing Bugs in Software

- Providing fixes for bugs in software is an important step in the software engineering process.
- In this step, we show how the bug was fixed and how the code was changed to solve the issue.
- In this step, it is important to demonstrate that the fix is not an over engineered solution for the bug.
- We show that the fix is as simple as possible.
- This step also determines the confidence in the bug fix.
- This step is helpful for the developers in the maintenance of the software.
- This step also helps the developers in testing if the bug is fixed or not.
- Also, this is helpful in understanding the code.
