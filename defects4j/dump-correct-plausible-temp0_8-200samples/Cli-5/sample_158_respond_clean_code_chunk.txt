- The process of developing software is a combinatorial one.
- Design and implementation decisions interact with one another in often non-obvious ways.
- Change one thing and it may break something else somewhere else.
- A bug may manifest itself in non-obvious ways.
- **Debugging is an iterative process of hypothesis testing**.
- Bug fixing is further complicated by the complexity of modern software.
- Modern software development is a complex process.
