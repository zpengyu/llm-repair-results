+To devise a metric for feature reduction.
+The metric for feature reduction is the number of features for which the prediction change is less than 0.01%.
+Feature Reduction is implemented in the following [python notebook](https://github.com/soumendukrg/FeatureElimination/blob/master/Feature%20Reduction.ipynb)
