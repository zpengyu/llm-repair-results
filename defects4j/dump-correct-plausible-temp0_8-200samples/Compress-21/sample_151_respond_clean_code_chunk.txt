Unit testing is the cornerstone of extreme programming and is also adopted by other Agile software development methodologies. Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use.
Unit tests are created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers during the development process. Each test case is independent from the others. Replacing a unit with a mock implementation that responds with predefined results, isolates the test cases from external dependencies.
