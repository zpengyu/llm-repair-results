+* Prepare
+  *  a bug report of the bug that you want to fix
+  *  a test case that can reproduce the bug
+* Run the tool with `-f` (file-based) or `-u` (url-based) option.
+  * `-f` option: run the tool with a bug report file
+  * `-u` option: run the tool with a bug report url
+* Find the defective code and fix it.
+  * The tool first finds the buggy code file and runs unit tests.
+    * If the tool finds failing unit tests, it analyzes failed messages and bug reports. Then, it generates specific and general patches for the bug.
+    * If the tool does not find failed unit tests, it automatically generates patches for the bug.
+  * The tool prints out the generated patches on the console.
+* Apply the generated patches to the defective code.
+* Run unit tests and check whether the bug is fixed.
+  * If a bug is fixed, the tool shows a message `The bug is fixed!`.
+  * If a bug is not fixed, the tool shows a message `The bug is not fixed!`.}
