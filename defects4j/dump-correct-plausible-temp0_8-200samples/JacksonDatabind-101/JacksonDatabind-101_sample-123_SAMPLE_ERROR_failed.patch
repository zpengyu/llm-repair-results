+a) Describe two key differences between static and dynamic code analysis.
+Static analysis is performed before a program executes. Dynamic analysis is performed while a program executes.
+Dynamic analysis is for finding more critical bugs.
+b) Give an example of when a static analysis tool would be a better choice than dynamic analysis.
+Static analysis is cheaper than dynamic analysis.
+It is ideal for finding typos and other minor bugs.
+c) Give an example of when a dynamic analysis tool would be a better choice than static analysis.
+To find security vulnerabilities, a dynamic analysis is more appropriate.
+To test programs that require external input, a dynamic analysis is more appropriate.
+To test programs that require a long run time, a dynamic analysis is more appropriate.
+To find hard-to-find concurrency bugs, a dynamic analysis is more appropriate.
+a) Describe two techniques that a dynamic analysis tool might use to improve the efficiency of its search.

+c) Give an example of a dynamic analysis technique that could be used to reduce the number of test cases that have to be considered when a program is executing.
