+A combined approach of SMT and Data Mining techniques work well in predicting buggy functions. The combined approach can
+achieve higher accuracy compared to the independent approaches.
+* SMT: Higher precision, lower recall.
+* Data Mining: Higher recall, lower precision.
+However,
+* SMT is time-consuming.
+* Data Mining is less time-consuming.
