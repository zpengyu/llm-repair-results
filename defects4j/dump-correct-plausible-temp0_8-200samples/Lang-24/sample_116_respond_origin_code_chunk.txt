#Conclusion:
- Recognize the importance of maintaning and reusing code; 
- Avoid duplication.
- Help is within reach.
- Bad code costs money
- Good code is always worth the time and money

##Manual Review:
- Manual review is the most common approach to detecting and fix bugs
- More than half of all bugs are found by manual review
- Manual review is effective at detecting and fixing bugs early in the development cycle.
- Manual review is effective at detecting and fixing bugs in code that is not well tested.
- Manual review is very effective at detecting and fixing errors in design, implementation, and testing.
- Manual review is effective at detecting and fixing bugs in almost all code.
- Manual review is effective at fixing bugs in test cases.

##Code Review:
- Code review is a software quality assurance (QA) activity in which one or several people check a program mainly by viewing and reading parts of its source code, and they do so after implementation or as an interruption of implementation
- Almost every company does code review.
- Developers spend about one day every week on code review.
- Code reviews lead to better software.
- About 70% of the bugs found in code review are syntax errors.
- Code reviews lead to better software architecture.
- Code reviews lead to better communication among developers.
- Code reviews lead to less time spent on debugging.

##Benefits of code review
- Improves software quality
- Improves design
- Reduces bugs
- Improves communication
- Improves developers skills
- Improves team morale

##Lack of code review
- Code duplication
- Poor design
- Poor coding style
- Lack of unit tests
- Bugs, bugs, bugs
- Improper use of testing
- Lack of source code control
