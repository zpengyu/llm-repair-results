The attached file "assignment1.zip" contains a collection of programs.
- You will need to unzip the folder.
- The files are in Java
- The files are buggy.
- You will be required to find and fix the bug(s) for each file.
- You will need to use the NetBeans IDE to load and run the buggy program.
- You can run the buggy program by right-clicking on the name of the program (the name of the file in the left pane of NetBeans) and selecting "Run File"
- You will need to submit (to the dropbox) a document with the results, bug and the fix. The document should have the following format:
